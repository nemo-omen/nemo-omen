### Hi! I'm Jeff Caldwell.

I'm a computer science student, a frontend web developer, and a small-city digital journalist.

I love making websites and I'm constantly learning. Currently, I'm most interested in accessibility and IndieWeb. I think the principles of each can help to make the web a better place for everyone.
